## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**MPC controller for agile quadrupedal robots** | ETH Zurich | Sep. 2020 - Mar. 2021  
Semester project | Supervisor: Prof. Stelian Coros, the Computational Robotics Lab  
- Proposed a new bipartite graph representation to express  CoPs' dependency on footholds, which helps to establish the input constraints in linear form.
- Implemented a MPC controller that can generate a dynamically feasible and stable trajectory and track a given reference trajectory using Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model.
- Solved the LMPC and NMPC problem numericallly with QP and SQP with damped BFGS updating, respectively.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Teaching Assistant for Linear System Theory** | ETH Zurich | Jul. 2020 - Aug. 2020
- Worked on the exercises of Linear System Theory. Got more familiar with LaTeX.

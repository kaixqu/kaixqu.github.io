RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
======  
**MPC controller for agile quadrupedal robots**

Semester Project | The Computational Robotics Lab, ETH Zurich | Sep. 2020 - Mar. 2021 (Expected)

Supervisor: Prof. Stelian Coros, Department of Computer Science
  - Proposed a new bipartite graph representation to express  CoPs' dependency on footsteps plans, which helps us establish the input constraints.
  - Implemented a MPC controller that can generate a dynamically feasible and stable trajectory and track a given reference trajectory using Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model.
  - Solved the MPC problem with Sequential Quadratic Programming with BFGS approximation.


WORK EXPERIENCE
======
- Summer 2020: Teaching Assistant for Linear System Theory, ETH Zurich
  - Worked on the exercises of Linear System Theory. Got more familiar LaTeX.

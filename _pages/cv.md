### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**MPC controller for agile quadrupedal robots** | ETH Zurich | Sep. 2020 - now

  - *Semester project under the supervisor of Prof. Stelian Coros, The Computational Robotics Lab*
  - Proposed a new bipartite graph representation to express  CoPs' dependency on footsteps plans, which helps us establish the input constraints.
  - Implemented a MPC controller that can generate a dynamically feasible and stable trajectory and track a given reference trajectory using Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model.
  - Solved the MPC problem with Sequential Quadratic Programming with BFGS approximation.


### WORK EXPERIENCE

**Teaching Assistant for Linear System Theory** | ETH Zurich | Jul. 2020 - Aug. 2020

  - Worked on the exercises of Linear System Theory. Got more familiar LaTeX.
